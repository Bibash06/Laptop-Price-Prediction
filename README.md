# Assignment

My task is to define and train a machine learning model for predicting the price of a laptop (buynow_price column in the dataset) based on its attributes. When testing and comparing  models, my aim is to minimize the RMSE measure.

# Practicalities
Prepare a model in Jupyter Notebook using Python. Only use the training data for training the model and check the model's performance on unseen data using the test dataset to make sure it does not overfit.
